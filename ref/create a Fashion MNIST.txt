create a Fashion MNIST project with PyTorch and experiment on these criteria
- pre-built dataset (MNIST/ CIFAR, COCO) same things.
- not going any modular
- using tranfer learning
- Experiement tracking with tensorboard


create another project, like FoodVision/ Oxford flower
- custom dataset
- going modular
- transfer learning
- Experiement tracking with weight and biases
- Model deployment


- replicating vision transformer
