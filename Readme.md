# Oxford Flower 102 



#

## Motivation

This project will put an end to my endless learning curve these days, I'll leverage all of those techniques, knowledge I've learned so far to put on this project for real, 

I'm not interest on car, plant, animal, transport,..such those things out there. Flowers are all I needed, So I came up with idea using the biggest flower dataset I got on Kaggle, (Actually I found out this dataset first then the Idea come later to me).
By the way, let's get this shit done.


- This project was supposed to run on Kaggle, 'Cause my local machine was just supported with Nvidia 1060, so I mean it's so weak I can feel, But don't worry, I also take advantage of it, find out the limitation of my GPU.
