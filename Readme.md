# Oxford Flower 102 



#

## Motivation

This project will put an end to my endless learning curve these days, I'll leverage all of those techniques, knowledge I've learned so far to put on this project for real, 

I'm not interest on car, plant, animal, transport,..such those things out there. Flowers are all I needed, So I came up with idea using the biggest flower dataset I got on Kaggle, (Actually I found out this dataset first then the Idea come later to me).
By the way, let's get this shit done.


- This project was supposed to run on Kaggle, 'Cause my local machine was just supported with Nvidia 1060, so I mean it's so weak I can feel, But don't worry, I also take advantage of it, find out the limitation of my GPU.

- There's alot of thing concerned me with Kaggle, I'm not gonna run this project in cloud anymore, Use cloud computing for good.


#### oke my self, just hear me out clearly,

- First 1, running on local was a bad move => Running all of code on Kaggle for good, and convenient

- Commit on local, but not push on github

- Using kaggle as the main Jupiter server 

- Why : 

    high computational power

    big input and outout source of storage, up to 20GB, too much, must utilize it.

    Everything run into a notebook, I like it, Maybe we have to choose going modular method for good, 

    Kaggle's not really have good syncing process with Github, just commit the notebook directly not pull the new code from local.

    So use Kaggle from now on for good, do not touching into the notebook_dl in local for good..

- Kaggle: notebook deep learning, Commit only from Kaggle, not from local or Colab, I don't want to make any wrong move anymore.

- colab : notebook machine learning

- Local : doing something else.


### *Update*

- Change to the modular to keep the kaggle notebook more clean and clarity to us, 

- And mimic the Pytoch Zero to Hero style, I think It has became standard for decade., or you can make your own way to implement it.
